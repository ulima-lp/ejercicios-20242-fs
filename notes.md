## Real World Haskell
- In Haskell, we deemphasize code that modifies data. Instead, we focus on functions
that take immutable values as input and produce new values as output. Given the same
inputs, these functions always return the same results. This is a core idea behind functional programming.
- We defer every computation until its result is actually needed—Haskell is a lazy language.
- When we consider runtime performance, Haskell almost always has a huge advantage. Code compiled by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) is typically between 20 to 60 times faster than code run through a dynamic language’s interpreter
- After three years of work, the committee published the Haskell 1.0 specification in 1990. It named the language after Haskell Curry, an influential logician.
- Since its publication in 1990, the Haskell language standard has seen five revisions, most recently in 1998
- We can tell it to print more type information as follows:
  - `ghci> :set +t`
